# CS441-prog4

This app presents the user with a table filled with numbers 1-100 ordered 1-100. 
The order of the numbers is based off of an online poll I once found that had users pick a random number.
Those random numbers were then ordered from most to least picked.
The poll results can be found here  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hG_25DCI2fMz210fCt84q-sVth3CNRBAT1OlT7zvKBk/edit#gid=1798635135.

There is also a second activity which is a graph of a straight line with two sliders. The first slider adjusts the m value of the graph, and the second slider adjusts the b value.

Unfortunately, I was unable to get the online connectivity working. The line "netTask = new NetTask("https://cs.binghamton.edu/~pmadden/php/double.php", request, handle);" kept giving me an error saying that my handle was invalid.
I was unable to come up with a workaround at the time of submission.
